Forever Family Foundation is honored to have you as a new member, <Mary Jones>, and we welcome you to our flourishing worldwide family



(See attached SAMPLE letter currently used when new members are snail mailed the new member kit.  This will need updating to allow this new process to make sense.  We would need to have links to the "enclosures" that they can access from the page and somehow retain access to those pages after the welcome letter CMS page is closed.  The enclosures that we normally include with the kit most likely will already be webpages for individual events, raffles, notices, etc that can now be links  But we also have a pdf file that is a "Kit."  We also would like to add to the letter their basic profile info - below- with the reminder that they can return to their profile at any time to make changes and updates.)



Your new member information has been listed as:

<name>

<add>

<email>

<other family members>





NOTE:  Once you can advise us of what can and can't be done, we can complete the letter in it final form.
